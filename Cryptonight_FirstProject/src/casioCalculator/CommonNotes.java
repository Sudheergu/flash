	//What is an Interface : Is a service contract b/w two parties.
	//An Interface is just like a class which will have only abstract functions.
	//Same naming conventions of a class will be applicable to an Interface
	 // What is abstract function : A function without body .
	//A Class has to inherit the interface and then that class must implement all the abstract functions
	  // available in the interface.
	// The same interface can be implemented by different classes.
	
	// Class inherits other class with extends keyword
	// Class inherits other interface with implements keyword.
	// Class can inherit multiple interfaces at a time
	//Implementing the inherited abstract functions inside a child class is called abstraction or method overriding.
	//MethodOverriding is one of the Oops concept of Polymorphism. 
	
	//Assignments :
	
	//Write a program to find sum of all numbers , read the numbers in an array as a input to the program.
	//Generate a series of numbers with Starting Number : 4 , CommonDifference : 3 , print 10 numbers. //4,7,10,13 ...
	//Rewrite the above program to read SN,CD,TotalCount as inputs to the program.
	//Write a program with practical example to demonstrate simple inheritance
	//Write a program with practical example to demonstrate multiple inheritance
	//Write a program with practical example to demonstrate heirarchial inheritance
	//Try to implement the above three concepts with object creation
	//Write a program to show constructor overloading , take your own example
