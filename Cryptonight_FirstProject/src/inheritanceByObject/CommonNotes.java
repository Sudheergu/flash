	//Demonstrate public  modifier with multiple packages - Done
	//Demonstrate default modifier with multiple classes with in a package - Done
	//Demonstrate how to use protected access modifier in inheritance . Why can't we use protected 
	 // in case of object creation - show it with code example
	//What is Constructor , Rules to write a constructor 
		//How to create an instance of a class with the help of constructor
		//What is constructor overloading
		//Default constructor
		
	//if there is no constructor written in a class then default constructor will be written by the system.
	//if there is any constructor with arguments then default constructor will never be created by the system.
	//if there is only parameterized constructors in a class then we can say there is no default constructor in that class.
	//Incase of extending the class also we need a constructor , we can not inherit any class without calling its constructor.
	 //So having a constructor to a class is mandatory.
	//We can not extend a class without having default constructor in the parent class.
	   //Prove the above statement with a practical code example
